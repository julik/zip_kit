# Will be used to pick whether to store a file in the `stored` or
# `deflated` mode, by compressing the first N bytes of the file and
# comparing the stored and deflated data sizes. If deflate produces
# a sizable compression gain for this data, it will create a deflated
# file inside the ZIP archive. If the file doesn't compress well, it
# will use the "stored" mode for the entry. About 128KB of the
# file will be buffered to pick the appropriate storage mode. The
# Heuristic will call either `write_stored_file` or `write_deflated_file`
# on the Streamer passed into it once it knows which compression
# method should be applied
